## Main features
- Order book matching engine for time, price and product matching
- ERC 1155 / ERC 1888 compatible

## Trading product concept

### Definition

`Product` defines the characteristics of the given producing device as well as buyers preferences . Currently it's represented as:

```
export class Product {
    public deviceType?: string[];

    public location?: string[];

    public deviceVintage?: number;
}
```

Where

- `deviceType` - describes the type of the device for e.g. using I-REC types
- `location` - describes the location of the the device for e.g. can be multi-level like Country->Region->Province
- `deviceVintage` - describes the vintage of the device for e.g. the start year of the device operation

For a producing device all fields are mandatory.

## Development

Default TypeOrm configuration requires running PostgreSQL database. The detailed config is:

```
TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
            type: 'postgres',
            host: 'localhost',
            port: 5432,
            username: 'postgres',
            password: 'postgres',
            database: 'origin-exchange',
            entities: [Demand, Order, Trade],
            synchronize: true,
            logging: ['query']
        }),
```

```
yarn
yarn start
```

### PostgreSQL installation using Docker

```
docker pull postgres
docker run --name origin-postgres -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```
